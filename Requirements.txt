a fixture is made up of two teams
a list of fixtures is published as a gameweek, with a deadline (first ko)
players of the game submit scores for each fixture before the deadline
fixture results are submitted after each fixture has been played
players are scored on the accuracy of their predictions
	3 points for correct score
	1 point for correct outcome (homewin, awaywin, draw)


admin can add a gameweek with a deadline
