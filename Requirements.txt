a fixture is made up of two teams
a list of fixtures is published as a gameweek, with a deadline (first ko)
players of the game submit scores for each fixture before the deadline
fixture results are submitted after each fixture has been played
players are scored on the accuracy of their predictions
	3 points for correct score
	1 point for correct outcome (homewin, awaywin, draw)


admin can add a gameweek with fixtures with deadlines
admin can add fixtures to a gameweek before submitting
if gameweek must be changed after submitting any submitted player scores must be dropped
players can work on open fixtures up until deadline
admin can submit fixture results at any time
players can review their score for previous gameweeks
	all weeks view, table of gwno & points
	in detail view with predicions v results, outcome & points
league table includes number of fixtures player has submitted predictions for
league table includes player accuracy index score (function of prediction v result difference, sum & home away separate)
league position vs gameweek line chart
sum points for all users per week to see high/low scoring weeks
compare outcome variation each week to see which game weeks are more/less predictable
